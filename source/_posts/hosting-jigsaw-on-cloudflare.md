Jigsaw by Tighten is an open source package that allows you to easily generate a static website, for your blog or your project's documentation.

In this post we'll walk through the steps needed to host a Jigsaw generated website on Cloudflare, using Cloudflare workers.

```php
class Foo extends bar
{
    public function fooBar()
    {
        //
    }
}
```

```blade
@extends('layouts.master')

@section('slave')
    <p class="black">Yes I am controversial</p>
@endsection
```
